        <p>
            Welcome, to my new website! This is not my first website and experience with HTML.
            I have picked up quite well at my internships. I am a fourth year undergrade student majoring in ITM. I grew up in
            Oswego, IL. </p>
            <p>It is a small town outside of Chicagoland and it is actually quite boring.
            Hopefully, with the new skills I have learned at my internship I will be able to create betetr websites than ever before
            Thank you, and hope to read your guys' resumes and bios. I have  shared some photos of my daily life. It maybe quite 
            entry levelso bare with me. This will be a new experience for everyone in the class. 
        </p>
