        <h1>Jocelyne Herrera | Bio</h1>
        <p> Welcome to my new website. This is not my first website and experience with HTML.
        I have picked up quite well at my internships. I am a fourth year undergrade student majoring in ITM. I grew up in 
        Oswego, IL. It is a small town outside of Chicagoland and it is actually quite boring. </p>
        <p>Hopefully, with the new skills I have learned at my internship I will be able to create betetr websites than ever before
        Thank you, and hope to read your guys' resumes and bios.</p>
