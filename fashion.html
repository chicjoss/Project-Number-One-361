        <h3> Understanding Fasion as a Hobby</h3>
        <p>Fashion has always been something part of my life. It often follows me
        everywhere I go. I believe it helps people express how they feel but without saying
        a word. It is a way you can present yourself and experiment with new looks everyday. </p>
